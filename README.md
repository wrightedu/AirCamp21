### Useful linux tips
### `man`
One of the most important commands in linux is the `man` command.  Typing 
`man` followed by the name of another command shows you the online manual 
for that command (for example, `man ls` shows you the manual for the `ls` 
command).
* You can search a man page by typing `/` followed by the words you are looking for.
* `n` will take you to the next occurence of your last search
* `p` will take you to the previous occurence of your last search
* `q` will exit out of the man page

Each challenge provides you with a list of possibly helpful linux commands.  
If you get stuck or are unsure about what a command does just check that command's `man` page.

### `ctrl` + `c`
The next most important command isn't so much a command as it is a shortcut.  
`Ctrl` + `c` or shorthand `^c` means hold down the Ctrl key and type the 
letter `c`.  This shortcut sends a signal to the current process telling it to 
stop.

There are several commands used throughout this competition that may take a 
while (minutes) and if mistyped could run indefinitely.  Use `ctrl` + `c` to 
stop these commands.
