### Rules

1. Nothing illegal
2. If you have any questions, ask!
3. Have fun!

### Getting started

2. Write your group members names on a piece of paper, this is where you will write down any flags you find.
   (please only use one sheet per group)
3. Check out the challenge1.md for details about each of the flags!

### Useful linux tips (may or may not apply elsewhere)
### `man`
One of the most important commands in linux is the `man` command.  Typing 
`man` followed by the name of another command shows you the online manual 
for that command (for example, `man ls` shows you the manual for the `ls` 
command).
* You can search a man page by typing `/` followed by the words you are looking for.
* `n` will take you to the next occurence of your last search
* `p` will take you to the previous occurence of your last search
* `q` will exit out of the man page

Each challenge provides you with a list of possibly helpful linux commands.  
If you get stuck or are unsure about what a command does, just check that command's `man` page.

### `Google`
While not a linux command, still sometimes useful...  Feel free to google any of the challenge
topics or hints, but dont forget you might need to play with the command to figure out how 
its really working.

### `ctrl` + `c`
The next most important command isn't so much a command as it is a shortcut.  
`Ctrl` + `c` or shorthand `^c` means hold down the Ctrl key and type the 
letter `c`.  This shortcut sends a signal to the current process telling it to 
stop.

There are several commands used throughout this competition that may take a 
while (minutes) and if mistyped could run indefinitely.  Use `ctrl` + `c` to 
stop these commands.
